weewx station registry
24nov2013 mwall

this is a quick hack to enable weewx stations to phone home so they can be
plotted on a google map.  stations phone home periodically with their url,
location, lat/lon, and station type.  these data are plotted on a map.  if
a station does not phone home after a certain period of time it will be
removed from the map.

as of weewx 2.5, the client-side of station registry is included in the
weewx distribution in restful.py.


these are the server-side bits:

register.cgi - runs on the web server, accepts connections from stations

mkstations.pl - generate the html page by injecting station data into template

savecounts.pl - record changes to number and types of stations

archivelog.pl - rollover the register logfile

stations.html.in - template html page

crontab.reg - crontab entries for generating pages, log rollover, history


to configure the server:

1) install prerequisites

apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl

2) install the cgi script

cp register.cgi /var/lib/cgi-bin

3) set up database location

mkdir /var/lib/weewx
chown www-data /var/lib/weewx

4) configure crontab to generate the html page

crontab -u www-data crontab.reg
